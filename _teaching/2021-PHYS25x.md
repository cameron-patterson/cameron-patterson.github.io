A 15-week series of experimental modules. I assisted the students while they undertook 1-week experiments on topics including blackbody radiation and waves in a coaxial cable.

My duties also included marking the students' weekly logbooks.

These labs took place during the COVID-19 pandemic and the cohort consisted of both in-person and online learners.
