A 15-week series of experimental modules.

I assisted the students while they undertook a combination of 1-week and 2-week experiments on topics including blackbody radiation, waves in a coaxial cable, Fraunhofer diffraction and single photon interference.

My duties also included marking the students' weekly logbooks and final week presentations.
