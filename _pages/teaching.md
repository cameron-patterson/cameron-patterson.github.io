The following are courses which I have taught.

### PHYS253, PHYS254 & PHYS255 Experimental Lab (2020-2022)
- I assisted the students while they undertook a combination of 1-week and 2-week experiments on topics including blackbody radiation, waves in a coaxial cable, Fraunhofer diffraction and single photon interference
- My duties also included marking the students' weekly logbooks and final week presentations
- These labs took place during the COVID-19 pandemic and the cohort consisted of both in-person and online learners
