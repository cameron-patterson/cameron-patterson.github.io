I am a **doctoral student** in the [Space and Planetary Physics Group](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/physics/research/astrophysics/space-and-planetary-physics/) at Lancaster University. I am interested in **solar-terrestrial physics** with an emphasis on **space weather**: conditions of the Sun-Earth environment that can affect human activity and technology in space and on the ground.

My research focus is currently on the impacts of space weather on **railway signalling** systems in the United Kingdom, you can find out more about that [here](https://cameron-patterson.github.io/research/).

I enjoy taking part in departmental teaching activites as a postgraduate teaching assistant (PGTA), over the past 2 years I have supported 2nd year undergraduates during their experimental labs both in-person and online.

Alongide my physics-based activities I also act as a **student ambassador** for the [Lancaster University Confucius Institute](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/confucius-institute/), promoting the study of **Chinese language** and cultural exchange to students, staff and the public. You can find out more about that [here](https://cameron-patterson.github.io/china/).
