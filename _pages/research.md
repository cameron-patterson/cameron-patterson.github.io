## Railway Signalling

A railway line is split into multiple blocks.

## Track Circuits

Insulated joints separate each block from its neighbours, while the continuous rail is connected across all blocks. A power supply is connected to the side of the circuit from which the train enters (left in this case) and an accompanying resistor to protect it from short circuiting; the relay is on the far end of the block (right in this case), formed of resistors and an electromagnet which in (a) is energised by the power supply, causing the switch to be in the configuration to display a green light, indicating the section is clear. When a train enters the block, as in (b), the wheels and axle short circuit said power supply causing the electromagnet to be de-energised, the switch falls to the configuration that displays a red light, indicating the section is occupied.
