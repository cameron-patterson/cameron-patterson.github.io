# 'Chinese Bridge'
I am the **European champion** and **world runner-up** of the 2015 'Chinese Bridge' Chinese Proficiency Competition for Foreign College Students. After coming first place in the UK regional final, I spent 4 weeks in China competing in 'Chinese Bridge', which included public speaking, tests on historical and cultural knowledge and literacy.

The competition was televised and you can watch all episodes on YouTube [here](https://youtu.be/c7_pgY1ycdQ?list=PLUM8x224JrX9BfLpy8aHVpxijUhHkEEfx&t=785).

# Cardiff and Vale College
From June 2019 to September 2020, I was the International Officer - China Programme Specialist at Cardiff and Vale College in Wales. My duties involved receiving visiting groups of students and dignitaries from China to Cardiff and travelling to China to expand our business connections, involving meetings with schools, agencies and local and provincial governments.

# Confucius Institute
I have been a volunteer at a Confucius Institute since 2011, including Cardiff and Lancaster. During that time I have involved myself in many aspects of their work, including bilingual show presenting, event organising, cultural activities and public outreach. From April 2022, I have been a part-time student ambassador at the Lancaster University Confucius Institute, aiding with teaching activities and festival events.
