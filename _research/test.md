The Mars of several billion years ago is a very different Mars than that of today. Several billion years ago, Mars was geologically active from core to crust, possessed a much thicker atmosphere, and had an internally produced magnetic field. 

Today, **remnants of this former magnetic field remain**, in effect frozen into the surface of Mars. A currently orbiting spacecraft, **MAVEN**, has obtained measurements above these fields; allowing for the **large-scale characterization of these remnants** to provide insight into to the historical evolution and eventual, termination, of Mars' formerly active field. See below for a video of some current work. We are working on teasing apart this interaction using Bayesian methods as funded through a NASA AI Use Case grant.
